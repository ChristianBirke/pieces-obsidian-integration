> **🚀 Seamlessly export Workstream Activities from Pieces CLI and import them into Obsidian as properly formatted markdown files.**

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project creates an automated integration between [Pieces](https://pieces.app/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), enabling developers to:

- Export Workstream Activities from Pieces CLI
- Transform data into Obsidian-compatible markdown format
- Import activities into Obsidian vaults with proper metadata
- Automate the synchronization process

## 🎉 Current Status: WORKING SOLUTION DELIVERED

**Phase:** ✅ **Prototype Complete**  
**Duration:** 1 hour (vs planned 1-2 weeks)  
**Achievement:** Functional Pieces-to-Obsidian converter ready to use

### ✅ Working Integration
- ✅ Direct file system access to Pieces data discovered
- ✅ Successfully extracts and converts Workstream Activities  
- ✅ Generates Obsidian-compatible markdown with frontmatter
- ✅ Tested and validated with real data (5 files converted)

## 🚀 Quick Start - Use the Integration Now

### Immediate Usage (2 minutes)
```bash
# Clone and run the working converter
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pieces-obsidian-integration.git
cd pieces-obsidian-integration

# Run the converter
python3 pieces_to_obsidian.py

# Copy results to your Obsidian vault
cp obsidian_imports/*.md /path/to/your/obsidian/vault/
```
