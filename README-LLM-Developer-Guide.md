## 🎯 Current Project Status: **EPIC 1.0 - RESEARCH PHASE**

### What You Need to Do Right Now
The project is in the **Research & Discovery** phase. Your immediate tasks:

1. **Research Pieces CLI**
   - Install Pieces CLI tool
   - Understand how to export "Workstream Activities"
   - Document available export formats (especially markdown)
   - Test authentication and access methods

2. **Research Obsidian Integration**
   - Understand Obsidian's file structure and vault system
   - Research import mechanisms (file system vs plugins)
   - Test markdown import behaviors
   - Document metadata handling requirements

3. **Analyze Data Flow**
   - Export sample Workstream Activities from Pieces
   - Analyze the data structure and format
   - Map required transformations for Obsidian compatibility
   - Document any edge cases or special requirements

### 🔧 Technical Context You Need to Know

#### What is Pieces?
- Developer productivity tool that captures and organizes code snippets, conversations, and workflow activities
- Has a CLI tool for programmatic access
- "Workstream Activities" are structured records of development work
- Exports data in various formats including markdown

#### What is Obsidian?
- Knowledge management application using markdown files
- Stores data in "vaults" (folders with markdown files)
- Supports frontmatter metadata, linking, and tagging
- File-system based (can be manipulated externally)

#### Integration Challenge
- Export structured data from Pieces CLI
- Transform data to Obsidian-compatible markdown format
- Import into Obsidian vault with proper metadata and structure
- Maintain data integrity and relationships

## 🛠️ Development Approach

### Lean Development Principles
- **Minimal Viable Product First** - Get basic export/import working
- **Iterative Enhancement** - Add features incrementally
- **User-Centric Design** - Focus on actual user workflows
- **Modular Architecture** - Keep components loosely coupled
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Test early and often

### Recommended Tech Stack (from Epic 2.0)
- **Language**: Python 3.8+ (for CLI integration and file operations)
- **CLI Framework**: Click or Typer (user-friendly command interface)
- **Configuration**: YAML/JSON with Pydantic validation
- **Markdown Processing**: python-markdown or mistune
- **Testing**: pytest with coverage reporting
- **Documentation**: mkdocs or sphinx

## 📋 Epic Execution Strategy

- [ ] Technical feasibility assessment with recommended approach

### Epic 2.0 - Technical Architecture (NEXT)
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks | **Story Points**: 13
**Goal**: Design system architecture and specifications

### Epic 3.0 - Core Implementation (AFTER ARCHITECTURE)
**Duration**: 3-4 weeks | **Story Points**: 21
**Goal**: Build working integration with basic functionality

### Epic 4.0 - User Experience (ENHANCEMENT PHASE)
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks | **Story Points**: 18
**Goal**: Polish interface and add automation features

### Epic 5.0 - Testing & Documentation (FINAL PHASE)
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks | **Story Points**: 15
**Goal**: Ensure production readiness

## 🎯 Success Criteria for LLM Developers

### Immediate Success (Epic 1.0)
- [ ] Successfully export a Workstream Activity from Pieces CLI
- [ ] Document the exact data structure and format
- [ ] Successfully import a markdown file into Obsidian
- [ ] Identify the transformation requirements
- [ ] Recommend the best technical approach

### Project Success (Overall)
- [ ] User can run a single command to sync Pieces activities to Obsidian
- [ ] Data integrity is maintained throughout the process
- [ ] Process is reliable and handles errors gracefully
- [ ] Tool is configurable for different user setups
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation enables easy adoption

## 🚨 Important Considerations for LLMs

### Data Safety
- **Always backup data** before making changes to Obsidian vaults
- **Validate data integrity** after transformations
- **Handle authentication securely** for Pieces CLI access
- **Test with sample data first** before processing real user data

### User Experience
- **Provide clear error messages** with actionable solutions
- **Show progress feedback** for long-running operations
- **Make configuration simple** with sensible defaults
- **Document everything** that users need to know

### Code Quality
- **Write modular code** that's easy to test and maintain
- **Include comprehensive error handling** for all external dependencies
- **Use type hints** and docstrings for better code documentation
- **Follow Python best practices** and PEP standards

## 🔍 Research Starting Points

### Pieces CLI Documentation
- Official Pieces CLI documentation
- GitHub repository for Pieces CLI
- Community forums and discussions
- API documentation if available

### Obsidian Integration Research
