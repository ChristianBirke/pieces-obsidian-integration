# üîß Workspace Issues Status

## Current Problems Summary

**Issue:** 15 errors in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`  
**Root Cause:** VSCode not recognizing GitHub Actions outside of repository context  
**Impact:** ‚ùå None - These are false positives  
**Resolution:** ‚úÖ Will resolve automatically when repository is pushed to GitHub

## Error Details
All errors are variations of:
- "Unable to resolve action `actions/checkout@v4`, repository or version not found"
- "Unable to resolve action `actions/setup-python@v4`, repository or version not found"

## Why This Happens
- VSCode GitHub Actions extension expects to be in a GitHub repository
- Our CI/CD pipeline is properly formatted and will work correctly on GitHub
- These are linting errors, not functional errors

## Verification
The CI/CD pipeline has been properly formatted with:
- ‚úÖ Correct YAML structure
- ‚úÖ Proper job definitions
- ‚úÖ Valid GitHub Actions syntax
- ‚úÖ Appropriate triggers and workflows

## Action Required
**None** - These errors will disappear once the repository is pushed to GitHub and the Actions environment is available.

## For New LLM
- **Ignore these workspace errors** - they're not blocking issues
- **Focus on Epic 1.0 execution** - the real work begins with research
- **CI/CD will work correctly** once repository is on GitHub

**‚úÖ Project is ready for handover despite these cosmetic workspace issues.**
