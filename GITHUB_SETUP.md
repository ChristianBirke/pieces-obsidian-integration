- `enhancement` - Feature requests
- `documentation` - Documentation updates
- `good first issue` - Beginner-friendly tasks

### Project Board (Recommended)
1. **Go to:** Projects → New Project
2. **Template:** Basic Kanban
3. **Columns:**
   - 📋 **Backlog** - All planned work
   - 🔄 **In Progress** - Currently being worked on

3. **Make Changes** following Epic guidelines
4. **Create Pull Request** using the PR template
5. **Code Review** and approval
6. **Merge** to main branch

### CI/CD Pipeline
The included `.github/workflows/ci.yml` provides:
- ✅ **Code Quality** - Formatting and linting checks
- ✅ **Documentation** - Epic structure validation
- ✅ **Testing** - Automated test execution
- ✅ **Security** - Basic security scanning
- ✅ **Epic Progress** - Project status tracking

## 📊 Monitoring and Analytics

### GitHub Insights
