# Obsidian Integration Research

## Research Objective
Understand Obsidian's import mechanisms and integration patterns for external data.

## Research Status
ðŸ”„ **In Progress** - Epic 1.0, User Story 1.2

## Research Questions
- [ ] What are the available integration approaches (plugin vs external tool)?
- [ ] How does Obsidian handle file system imports?
- [ ] What are the vault structure requirements?
- [ ] How does Obsidian process markdown imports?
- [ ] What existing integration patterns can we learn from?
- [ ] How does metadata handling work in Obsidian?
- [ ] What are the linking and tagging capabilities?

## Integration Approaches

### 1. Plugin Development
**Pros:**
- [ ] Native integration
- [ ] Access to Obsidian API
- [ ] User-friendly interface

**Cons:**
- [ ] Requires TypeScript/JavaScript knowledge
- [ ] Plugin approval process
- [ ] Maintenance overhead

**Research Tasks:**
- [ ] Study Obsidian plugin architecture
- [ ] Review plugin development documentation
- [ ] Analyze existing data import plugins
- [ ] Test plugin installation and development setup

### 2. External Tool Integration
**Pros:**
- [ ] Language flexibility (Python, etc.)
- [ ] Independent development cycle
- [ ] Direct file system access

**Cons:**
- [ ] Less native integration
- [ ] Manual user setup required
- [ ] Vault structure dependencies

**Research Tasks:**
- [ ] Test direct file system imports
- [ ] Understand vault structure requirements
- [ ] Research file watching capabilities
- [ ] Test batch import scenarios

## Vault Structure Research

### Standard Vault Organization
```
vault-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ .obsidian/          # Obsidian configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ attachments/        # Media files
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/          # Note templates
â”œâ”€â”€ daily-notes/        # Daily notes
â””â”€â”€ notes/             # General notes
```

### Import Location Strategy
- [ ] Dedicated import folder
- [ ] Date-based organization
- [ ] Tag-based organization
- [ ] Project-based organization

## Markdown Processing

### Obsidian Markdown Features
- [ ] Standard markdown support
- [ ] Wikilinks: `[[Note Name]]`
- [ ] Tags: `#tag-name`
- [ ] Frontmatter YAML
- [ ] Callouts and admonitions
- [ ] Embedded files
- [ ] Mathematical expressions

### Import Considerations
- [ ] Frontmatter metadata handling
- [ ] Link conversion requirements
- [ ] Tag standardization
- [ ] File naming conventions

## Metadata Handling

### Frontmatter Structure
```yaml
---
title: "Note Title"
created: 2024-01-01
tags: [tag1, tag2]
source: "pieces-workstream"
activity-id: "12345"
---
```

### Metadata Research Tasks
- [ ] Test frontmatter import behavior
- [ ] Document supported metadata fields
- [ ] Test metadata search capabilities
- [ ] Research custom metadata fields

## Existing Integration Patterns

### Popular Import Plugins
- [ ] Plugin 1: Name and capabilities
- [ ] Plugin 2: Name and capabilities
- [ ] Plugin 3: Name and capabilities

### Integration Patterns Analysis
- [ ] File-based imports
- [ ] API-based imports
- [ ] Scheduled imports
- [ ] Manual trigger imports

## File System Integration

### Direct File Operations
```bash
# Test commands for file system integration
cp source-file.md /path/to/obsidian/vault/
```

### File Watching
- [ ] Research file watching libraries
- [ ] Test automatic import triggers
- [ ] Handle file conflicts and duplicates

## Testing Environment Setup

### Obsidian Test Vault
- [ ] Create dedicated test vault
- [ ] Configure test environment
- [ ] Prepare sample import data
- [ ] Document test procedures

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Single file import
- [ ] Batch file import
- [ ] Metadata preservation
- [ ] Link handling
- [ ] Tag processing
- [ ] Duplicate handling

- [ ] Requirement 2
- [ ] Requirement 3

### Implementation Considerations
- [ ] Consideration 1
- [ ] Consideration 2
- [ ] Consideration 3

## Next Steps

- [ ] Research plugin development if needed
- [ ] Document metadata handling approach
- [ ] Create sample import templates
- [ ] Update Epic 1.0 progress
