# Data Structure Analysis

## Research Objective
Analyze Workstream Activity export structure and design optimal data transformation approach.

## Research Status
ðŸ”„ **In Progress** - Epic 1.0, User Story 1.3

## Research Questions
- [ ] What is the structure of Pieces Workstream Activity exports?
- [ ] What data fields are available in exports?
- [ ] How are activities related to each other?
- [ ] What metadata is included with each activity?
- [ ] How should data be transformed for Obsidian import?
- [ ] What information might be lost in transformation?

## Sample Data Collection

### Export Samples Needed
- [ ] Single Workstream Activity export
- [ ] Multiple activities export
- [ ] Different activity types
- [ ] Activities with attachments
- [ ] Activities with code snippets
- [ ] Activities with links and references

### Sample File Structure
```
data-samples/
â”œâ”€â”€ pieces-exports/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ single-activity.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ multiple-activities.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ activity-with-code.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ activity-with-attachments.json
â”œâ”€â”€ obsidian-targets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ single-activity.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ multiple-activities/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ transformed-examples/
â””â”€â”€ analysis/
    â”œâ”€â”€ field-mapping.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ transformation-rules.md
    â””â”€â”€ data-loss-analysis.md
```

## Data Structure Analysis

### Pieces Export Format
```json
{
  "// TODO": "Add actual export structure after research"
}
```

### Key Data Fields
- [ ] Activity ID
- [ ] Timestamp/Date
- [ ] Activity Type
- [ ] Content/Description
- [ ] Tags/Categories
- [ ] Associated Files
- [ ] Metadata
- [ ] Relationships

### Obsidian Target Format
```markdown
---
title: "Activity Title"
created: 2024-01-01T10:00:00Z
pieces-id: "activity-12345"
activity-type: "code-snippet"
tags: [pieces, workstream, development]
---

# Activity Title

Activity content goes here...

## Metadata
- **Source:** Pieces Workstream
- **Activity ID:** 12345
- **Created:** 2024-01-01 10:00:00

## Related Activities
- [[Activity 12344]]
- [[Activity 12346]]
```

## Data Transformation Rules

### Field Mapping
| Pieces Field | Obsidian Field | Transformation Rule |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| id | pieces-id | Direct mapping |
| timestamp | created | ISO format conversion |
| title | title | Sanitize for filename |
| content | body | Markdown conversion |
| tags | tags | Array format |

### Content Transformation
- [ ] HTML to Markdown conversion
- [ ] Code snippet formatting
- [ ] Link preservation
- [ ] Image/attachment handling
- [ ] Special character escaping

### Metadata Preservation
- [ ] Original activity ID
- [ ] Creation timestamp
- [ ] Activity type classification
- [ ] Source system identification
- [ ] Relationship mapping

## Data Quality Analysis

### Potential Data Issues
- [ ] Missing required fields
- [ ] Inconsistent data formats
- [ ] Special characters in content
- [ ] Large file attachments
- [ ] Broken links or references

### Data Validation Rules
- [ ] Required field validation
- [ ] Data type validation
- [ ] Content length limits
- [ ] Character encoding validation
- [ ] Relationship integrity

## Transformation Strategy

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Extract:** Parse Pieces export data
2. **Transform:** Apply transformation rules
3. **Validate:** Check data quality
4. **Generate:** Create Obsidian markdown files
5. **Import:** Place files in vault structure

### Error Handling
- [ ] Invalid data handling
- [ ] Missing field defaults
- [ ] Transformation failures
- [ ] File system errors
- [ ] Duplicate detection

## Sample Data Templates

### Activity Template
```markdown
---
title: "{{ activity.title }}"
created: {{ activity.timestamp }}
pieces-id: "{{ activity.id }}"
activity-type: "{{ activity.type }}"
tags: {{ activity.tags }}
---

# {{ activity.title }}

{{ activity.content }}

## Metadata
- **Source:** Pieces Workstream
- **Activity ID:** {{ activity.id }}
- **Created:** {{ activity.timestamp }}
- **Type:** {{ activity.type }}

{% if activity.attachments %}
## Attachments
{% for attachment in activity.attachments %}
- [[{{ attachment.name }}]]
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if activity.related %}
## Related Activities
{% for related in activity.related %}
- [[{{ related.title }}]]
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
```
