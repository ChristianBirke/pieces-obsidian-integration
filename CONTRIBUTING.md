# Contributing to Pieces-to-Obsidian Integration

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This guide will help you get started with our Epic-driven development approach.

## üéØ Project Philosophy

This project follows **lean development principles**:
- Write as little code as possible, as much as needed
- Focus on user-centric design and actual workflows
- Maintain modular architecture with loose coupling
- Prioritize comprehensive testing and documentation
- Research thoroughly before implementing

## üìã Epic-Driven Development

Our development is organized into **Epics** (major features) containing **User Stories** (specific requirements):

### Current Epic Status
- **Epic 1.0 - Research & Discovery** üîÑ **ACTIVE**
- **Epic 2.0 - Technical Architecture** ‚è≥ Planned
- **Epic 3.0 - Core Implementation** ‚è≥ Planned
- **Epic 4.0 - User Experience & Automation** ‚è≥ Planned
- **Epic 5.0 - Testing & Documentation** ‚è≥ Planned

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For LLM Contributors
1. **Read the LLM Developer Guide:** [`README-LLM-Developer-Guide.md`](README-LLM-Developer-Guide.md)
2. **Review Current Epic:** [`01_Epics/Epic1.0-ResearchAndDiscovery.md`](01_Epics/Epic1.0-ResearchAndDiscovery.md)
3. **Check Technical Roadmap:** [`01_Epics/TechnicalRoadmap.md`](01_Epics/TechnicalRoadmap.md)
4. **Start with User Stories:** Pick an unassigned user story from the current Epic

### For Human Contributors
1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Read project documentation** in `01_Epics/`
3. **Set up development environment** (see `01_Epics/DevelopmentQuickStart.md`)
4. **Choose a User Story** from the current Epic
5. **Create a feature branch** for your work

## üìù Contribution Process

### 1. Choose Your Work
- **Current Phase:** Epic 1.0 - Research & Discovery
- **Available User Stories:**
  - US 1.1 - Pieces CLI Research
  - US 1.2 - Obsidian Integration Research
  - US 1.3 - Data Structure Analysis
  - US 1.4 - Technical Feasibility Assessment

### 2. Create a Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/epic1-us1.1-pieces-cli-research
```

### 3. Follow User Story Requirements
Each User Story has:
- **Clear acceptance criteria** - What must be completed
- **Technical notes** - Implementation guidance
- **Definition of done** - Quality standards

### 4. Document Your Work
- **Research findings** - Document all discoveries
- **Code changes** - Include comprehensive comments
- **Test results** - Validate your implementation
- **Update documentation** - Keep Epic files current

### 5. Submit Your Contribution
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Epic 1.0 US 1.1: Complete Pieces CLI research

- Document CLI capabilities and limitations
- Test export functionality for Workstream Activities
- Analyze available export formats
- Document authentication requirements
- Create sample data for testing

Closes #issue-number"
```

## üß™ Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- **Type hints** for all Python functions
- **Docstrings** for all modules, classes, and functions
- **Error handling** for all external dependencies
- **Unit tests** for all new functionality
- **Integration tests** for end-to-end workflows

### Documentation Quality
- **Clear explanations** of technical decisions
- **Step-by-step instructions** for setup and usage
- **Examples and sample data** for testing
- **Troubleshooting guides** for common issues
- **API documentation** for all public interfaces

### Research Quality (Epic 1.0 Specific)
- **Comprehensive analysis** of tools and capabilities
- **Sample data collection** with proper documentation
- **Edge case identification** and documentation
- **Performance considerations** and limitations
- **Security implications** and recommendations

## üîç Epic 1.0 - Research Guidelines

Since we're currently in the Research & Discovery phase, contributions should focus on:

### Pieces CLI Research
- Install and test Pieces CLI
- Document all available commands and options
- Test export functionality with real data
- Analyze data formats and structures
- Document authentication and access patterns

### Obsidian Integration Research
- Understand Obsidian vault structure
- Test markdown import behaviors
- Research plugin development options
- Analyze metadata handling requirements
- Document file system integration patterns

### Data Analysis
- Export sample Workstream Activities
- Document exact data schemas
- Identify transformation requirements
- Test data integrity and validation
- Create sample datasets for testing

## üìä Reporting Your Findings

### Research Reports
Create detailed reports in the following format:

```markdown
# Research Report: [Topic]

## Summary
Brief overview of findings and recommendations

## Methodology
How the research was conducted

## Findings
Detailed analysis with examples and data

## Recommendations
Suggested approach based on research

## Next Steps
What should be done next

## Appendix
Sample data, commands, screenshots, etc.
```

### Code Contributions
Follow this structure for code submissions:

```python
"""
Module: [module_name]
Epic: [epic_number]
User Story: [user_story_id]

Description: Brief description of functionality

Author: [your_name]
Date: [date]
"""

# Implementation with comprehensive comments
# Type hints for all functions
# Error handling for external dependencies
# Unit tests in separate test files
```

## üö® Important Considerations

### Data Safety
- **Never commit sensitive data** (API keys, personal information)
- **Use sample/test data only** for development
- **Backup data** before testing destructive operations
- **Validate data integrity** after transformations

### Security
- **Handle credentials securely** using environment variables
- **Validate all inputs** to prevent injection attacks
- **Use secure communication** for API calls
- **Document security considerations** in your contributions

### Performance
- **Test with realistic data volumes** when possible
- **Document performance characteristics** and limitations
- **Consider memory usage** for large datasets
- **Implement efficient algorithms** and data structures

## ü§ù Communication

### GitHub Issues
- **Bug reports** - Use the bug report template
- **Feature requests** - Use the feature request template
- **Questions** - Use GitHub Discussions instead

### Pull Requests
- **Clear titles** describing the change
- **Detailed descriptions** explaining the implementation
- **Link to related issues** and user stories
- **Include test results** and validation steps

### Code Reviews
- **Be constructive** and helpful in feedback
- **Focus on code quality** and adherence to standards
- **Test the changes** before approving
- **Suggest improvements** rather than just pointing out problems

## üìà Recognition
