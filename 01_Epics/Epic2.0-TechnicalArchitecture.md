# Epic 2.0 - Technical Architecture

## Epic Overview
Design and specify the technical architecture for the Pieces-to-Obsidian integration, defining the system components, data flow, and implementation approach.

## Epic Goals
- Define system architecture and component interactions
- Specify data transformation requirements
- Establish integration patterns and protocols
- Create technical specifications for implementation

## User Stories

### US 2.1 - System Architecture Design
**As a** developer  
**I want to** design the overall system architecture  
**So that** the integration is scalable, maintainable, and reliable  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create system architecture diagram
- [ ] Define component responsibilities and boundaries
- [ ] Specify communication protocols between components
- [ ] Document data flow from Pieces to Obsidian
- [ ] Define error handling and recovery mechanisms

**Technical Notes:**
- Consider modular design for easy testing
- Plan for future extensibility
- Document security considerations

### US 2.2 - Data Transformation Specification
**As a** developer  
**I want to** specify data transformation requirements  
**So that** Workstream Activities are properly formatted for Obsidian  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Define input data schema (Pieces format)
- [ ] Define output data schema (Obsidian format)
- [ ] Specify transformation rules and logic
- [ ] Document metadata mapping requirements
- [ ] Define content sanitization and validation rules

**Technical Notes:**
- Handle markdown formatting differences
- Preserve important metadata
- Consider Obsidian-specific features (links, tags, etc.)

### US 2.3 - Integration Pattern Selection
**As a** developer  
**I want to** select the optimal integration pattern  
**So that** the solution is efficient and maintainable  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Evaluate CLI-based integration approach
- [ ] Evaluate API-based integration approach
- [ ] Evaluate MCP server integration approach
- [ ] Document decision matrix with criteria and scores
- [ ] Select and justify the chosen approach

**Technical Notes:**
- Consider authentication requirements
- Evaluate real-time vs batch processing needs
- Document scalability implications

### US 2.4 - Configuration Management Design
**As a** user  
**I want to** configure the integration behavior  
**So that** it works with my specific setup and preferences  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Define configuration file structure
- [ ] Specify required vs optional configuration parameters
- [ ] Design configuration validation logic
- [ ] Document default values and behaviors
- [ ] Plan configuration update mechanisms

**Technical Notes:**
- Support multiple configuration formats (JSON, YAML, etc.)
- Include environment variable support
- Plan for secure credential storage

### US 2.5 - Error Handling and Logging Strategy
**As a** developer  
**I want to** design comprehensive error handling  
**So that** issues can be quickly identified and resolved  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Define error categories and severity levels
- [ ] Specify logging requirements and formats
- [ ] Design retry mechanisms for transient failures
- [ ] Plan user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Document troubleshooting procedures

**Technical Notes:**
- Include structured logging for analysis
- Consider log rotation and retention
- Plan for different verbosity levels

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete architecture documentation
- [ ] Technical specifications approved
- [ ] Data transformation rules defined
- [ ] Integration approach selected and documented
- [ ] Configuration and error handling strategies defined

## Dependencies
- Completion of Epic 1.0 (Research & Discovery)
- Stakeholder approval of technical approach

## Estimated Effort
**Story Points:** 13  
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks
