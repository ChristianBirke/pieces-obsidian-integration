# Pieces-to-Obsidian Integration Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a seamless integration between Pieces CLI and Obsidian, enabling users to export Workstream Activities from Pieces and import them into their Obsidian vault as properly formatted markdown files.

## Project Goals
- **Primary Goal:** Enable automated export of Workstream Activities from Pieces to Obsidian
- **Secondary Goals:** 
  - Provide flexible configuration options
  - Support batch processing and automation
  - Ensure data integrity and proper formatting
  - Create a user-friendly experience

## Epic Breakdown

### Epic 1.0 - Research & Discovery (1-2 weeks)
**Focus:** Understanding the technical landscape and feasibility
- Research Pieces CLI capabilities and API
- Analyze Obsidian integration patterns
- Study Workstream Activity data structure
- Establish technical approach

### Epic 2.0 - Technical Architecture (2-3 weeks)
**Focus:** Designing the system architecture and specifications
- Define system components and interactions
- Specify data transformation requirements
- Select integration patterns and protocols
- Design configuration and error handling

### Epic 3.0 - Core Integration Implementation (3-4 weeks)
**Focus:** Building the core functionality
- Implement Pieces export module
- Build data transformation engine
- Create Obsidian import functionality
- Establish error handling and validation

### Epic 4.0 - User Experience & Automation (2-3 weeks)
**Focus:** Enhancing usability and automation
- Create command-line interface
- Implement batch processing
- Add scheduling and automation
- Build monitoring and feedback systems

### Epic 5.0 - Testing & Documentation (2-3 weeks)
**Focus:** Ensuring quality and maintainability
- Comprehensive testing strategy
- User and developer documentation
- Quality assurance and release preparation
- Deployment and operations guidance

## Technical Approach (Preliminary)
Based on the research phase, the likely technical approach will involve:
- **Language:** Python (for CLI integration and file operations)
- **Integration Method:** CLI-based or API-based (to be determined in Epic 1.0)
- **Architecture:** Modular design with pluggable components
- **Data Flow:** Pieces → Export → Transform → Validate → Import → Obsidian

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can export Workstream Activities from Pieces
- [ ] Exported data is properly transformed for Obsidian
- [ ] Import process preserves data integrity and formatting
- [ ] Tool is configurable and user-friendly
- [ ] Process can be automated and scheduled
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation and testing

## Risk Mitigation
- **API Changes:** Design modular architecture to isolate external dependencies
- **Data Loss:** Implement validation and backup mechanisms
- **Performance:** Include performance testing and optimization
- **Usability:** Conduct user testing and feedback collection

## Project Timeline
**Total Estimated Duration:** 10-15 weeks
**Total Story Points:** 75 points

## Lean Development Principles
- **Minimal Viable Product:** Focus on core export/import functionality first
- **Iterative Development:** Build and test incrementally
- **User Feedback:** Incorporate feedback early and often
- **Code Efficiency:** Write as little code as possible while meeting requirements
- **Modular Design:** Enable easy testing and future extensions

## Next Steps
1. Begin Epic 1.0 - Research & Discovery
2. Set up development environment
3. Gather sample data and test cases
4. Establish communication channels with stakeholders
