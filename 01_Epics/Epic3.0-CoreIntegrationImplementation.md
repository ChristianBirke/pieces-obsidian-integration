# Epic 3.0 - Core Integration Implementation

## Epic Overview
Implement the core integration functionality to export Workstream Activities from Pieces and import them into Obsidian, following the architecture defined in Epic 2.0.

## Epic Goals
- Build Pieces CLI integration module
- Implement data transformation engine
- Create Obsidian import functionality
- Establish robust error handling and validation

## User Stories

### US 3.1 - Pieces Export Module
**As a** user  
**I want to** export Workstream Activities from Pieces  
**So that** I can access my data for import into Obsidian  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Implement Pieces CLI wrapper/interface
- [ ] Handle authentication and authorization
- [ ] Support single and batch export operations
- [ ] Implement export filtering and selection
- [ ] Validate exported data integrity

**Technical Notes:**
- Use subprocess or API calls as determined in Epic 2.0
- Implement proper error handling for CLI failures
- Support different export formats if available

### US 3.2 - Data Transformation Engine
**As a** developer  
**I want to** transform Pieces data into Obsidian format  
**So that** the imported content is properly structured and usable  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Implement markdown transformation logic
- [ ] Convert metadata to Obsidian frontmatter
- [ ] Handle embedded media and attachments
- [ ] Preserve content relationships and links
- [ ] Sanitize and validate transformed content

**Technical Notes:**
- Use markdown parsing libraries for robust handling
- Implement configurable transformation rules
- Handle edge cases and malformed data gracefully

### US 3.3 - Obsidian Import Module
**As a** user  
**I want to** import transformed data into Obsidian  
**So that** my Workstream Activities are available in my vault  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Implement file system operations for vault access
- [ ] Create proper directory structure in vault
- [ ] Handle file naming and conflict resolution
- [ ] Preserve file timestamps and metadata
- [ ] Support incremental and full import modes

**Technical Notes:**
- Respect Obsidian vault structure conventions
- Implement safe file operations with backups
- Handle concurrent access scenarios

### US 3.4 - Content Validation and Quality Assurance
**As a** user  
**I want to** ensure imported content is accurate and complete  
**So that** I can trust the integrity of my imported data  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Implement pre-import validation checks
- [ ] Verify content completeness and accuracy
- [ ] Check for data corruption or loss
- [ ] Validate markdown syntax and structure
- [ ] Generate import summary and reports

**Technical Notes:**
- Use checksums or hashing for integrity verification
- Implement rollback mechanisms for failed imports
- Provide detailed validation reports

### US 3.5 - Configuration Integration
**As a** user  
**I want to** configure the import process  
**So that** it works according to my preferences and setup  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Implement configuration file loading
- [ ] Support environment variable overrides
- [ ] Validate configuration parameters
- [ ] Provide configuration templates and examples
- [ ] Handle configuration updates gracefully

**Technical Notes:**
- Support multiple configuration formats
- Implement schema validation for configurations
- Provide clear error messages for invalid configurations

### US 3.6 - Basic Error Handling and Recovery
**As a** user  
**I want to** receive clear feedback when issues occur  
**So that** I can understand and resolve problems quickly  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error catching
- [ ] Provide user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Log detailed error information for debugging
- [ ] Implement basic retry mechanisms
- [ ] Support graceful degradation where possible

**Technical Notes:**
- Use structured logging for better analysis
- Implement different error handling strategies per component
- Provide actionable error messages with suggested solutions

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All core modules implemented and tested
- [ ] Integration works end-to-end with sample data
- [ ] Error handling covers major failure scenarios
- [ ] Configuration system functional
- [ ] Code reviewed and documented

## Dependencies
- Completion of Epic 2.0 (Technical Architecture)
- Development environment setup
- Access to Pieces CLI and test data

## Estimated Effort
**Story Points:** 21  
**Duration:** 3-4 weeks

## Technical Implementation Notes
- **Language:** Python (recommended for CLI integration and file operations)
- **Key Libraries:** 
  - `click` or `argparse` for CLI interface
  - `markdown` or `mistune` for markdown processing
  - `pyyaml` for configuration management
  - `pathlib` for file system operations
- **Architecture Pattern:** Command pattern with pluggable modules
- **Testing Strategy:** Unit tests for each module, integration tests for end-to-end flow
