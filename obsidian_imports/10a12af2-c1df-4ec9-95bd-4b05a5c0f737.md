# The error message indicates that there should be t...

The error message indicates that there should be two blank lines before the function definition. This is a common style guideline in Python to improve code readability. Hereâ€™s the corrected code snippet with the appropriate number of blank lines:

```python
import asyncio

from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("My MCP Server")


@mcp.tool
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """Greet a person by name"""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

Now, there are two blank lines before the `greet` function definition, which should resolve the error.
