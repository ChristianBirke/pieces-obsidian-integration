# To effectively diagnose issues related to the Just...

To effectively diagnose issues related to the Just Prompt server's startup or command execution, several debugging tools and techniques can be employed. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview based on the context of your project:

### Recommended Debugging Tools and Techniques

1. **Logging**:
   - **Implementation**: Utilize Python's built-in `logging` module to capture detailed logs of the server's operations. You can set different logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to control the verbosity of the output.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     import logging

     # Configure logging
     logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

     # Example log messages
     logging.info("Starting Just Prompt server...")
     logging.debug("Using model: %s", model_name)
     logging.error("Failed to start server: %s", error_message)
     ```

2. **Print Statements**:
   - **Implementation**: While not as sophisticated as logging, strategically placed print statements can help trace the flow of execution and identify where things may be going wrong.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     print("Initializing server...")
     print(f"Current model: {model_name}")
     ```

3. **Command-Line Arguments**:
   - **Implementation**: Use command-line arguments to control the logging level or to enable debugging features. This can be done using the `argparse` module.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     import argparse

     parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Just Prompt MCP Server')
     parser.add_argument('--log-level', choices=['DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR', 'CRITICAL'], default='INFO')
     args = parser.parse_args()

     logging.basicConfig(level=args.log_level)
     ```

4. **Interactive Debuggers**:
   - **Implementation**: Use Python debuggers like `pdb` to step through the code interactively. This allows you to inspect variables and the call stack at runtime.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
     ```

5. **Error Handling**:
   - **Implementation**: Implement robust error handling to catch exceptions and log them appropriately. This can help identify issues that occur during execution.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     try:
         # Code that may raise an exception
     except Exception as e:
         logging.error("An error occurred: %s", e)
     ```

6. **Testing with Unit Tests**:
   - **Implementation**: Write unit tests to validate the functionality of individual components of the Just Prompt server. This can help catch issues early in the development process.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     import unittest

     class TestJustPrompt(unittest.TestCase):
         def test_model_loading(self):
             self.assertTrue(load_model("openai:03"))
     ```

7. **Monitoring Server Output**:
   - **Implementation**: When running the server, monitor the output for any warnings or errors that may indicate issues with the startup process or command execution.
   - **Example**:
     ```bash
     uv run just-prompt --log-level DEBUG
     ```

### Summary

By implementing these debugging tools and techniques, you can gain better insights into the Just Prompt server's behavior during startup and command execution. Logging and print statements will provide visibility into the server's operations, while interactive debuggers and error handling will help you diagnose and resolve issues effectively. Additionally, using command-line arguments for configuration can enhance flexibility in debugging scenarios.
